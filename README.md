List of available kits for [VMCGUI](https://github.com/LSDRM/VMCGUI)
===============

Arduino based
----------
No arduino based kit has been developed yet.

Customized
----------
- [DualPressure - Thermocouple / through UART protocol](https://github.com/LSDRM/DualPressure-Thermocouple_forVMCGUI) : A DAQ board embeding two pressure sensors and one thermocouple. Developed by @B137P107

Raspberry Pi based
----------
No raspberry pi based kit has been developed yet.

Make your own kit
=============
This repository include a _#BlankKit.py_ file which is a base to start making your own kit, working with VMCGUI. Making your own kit requires a bit of electronical knowledge, especially if you want to do it by making your own DAQ board (i.e. without an Arduino or other ready-to-use DAQ board). Creating a new kit implies software and hardware development, the both parts are described below.

Software development
-----------
You should only need to make a python kit file from the _#BlankKit.py_, without modifying any file from the source code of VMCGUI.

Hardware development
-----------
### Arduino

### Customized

### Raspberry Pi
